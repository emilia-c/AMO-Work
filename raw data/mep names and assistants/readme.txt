Here is an explanation between these different jsons. 

1) cleaned_9term_MEPs.json
Cleaned the messed up countries and also checked for none values etc. 

2) cleaned_9term_MEPs_with_dates.json
Final json that I used - included information about when the page for assistant information was scraped. 

3)MEPs_9_term_AREYOUTHERE.json 
This file includes all of the meps with urls that I could scrape. It includes information from all of the meps I could scrape. 

4) MEPs_9term_with_assistants.json
This is my first try and only resulted in 482 meps. the code was reworked and then it got better.
